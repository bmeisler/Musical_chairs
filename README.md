A musical chairs animation built in createjs/javascript. To start the game: press the "Play Music" button. To make the players sit down, press the "Stop Music" button. NOTE: as of this time, the music is not playing.

Interesting part is how the players: 
1. find the closest chair and 
2. how 2 players figure out how to sit in one chair; that is, which 2 players are closest to a single chair?


This code is based on prototype-style classes.
