# Musical_chairs
An musical chairs animation built in createjs/javascript. Interesting part is how the players: 
1. find the closest chair and 
2. how 2 players figure out how to sit in one chair; that is, which 2 players are closest to a single chair?

This code is based on prototype-style classes.
